This event is in fact important due to it allowing persons to experience multiple food festivals during one Caribbean trip which is much easier rather than island hopping which can be very expensive and a major challenge  to individuals.                         It is also important to individuals as it gives them the opportunity to taste some of the local dishes as well as international dishes of the Caribbean.
